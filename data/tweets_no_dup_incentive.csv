@latsondheimer Should they trust it Eric ? The CDC reports over 4000 people have died from the vaccine.  The same number of people that have died from all vaccines combined in the US in the last 20 years.  I mean should they be rushing to get it ?
"Call me crazy, but I don't think the people who manipulated the message to hide the real science have the slightest right to pressure anyone to get the vaccine. I'm not saying there's something wrong with it. Maybe there isn't. I just don't trust them."
"@Basilisk_Art @SharylAttkisson You know not what you say. 
The vaccine was given in trust.
The disease may never have happened. 
Have you experienced the pain of seeing your child hurt from a vaccine you were told would help him.
Your comment was unwarranted."
"@DevilWearsMAGA @humanbeing10110 @RepThomasMassie Trust the Science right? I‚Äôm sorry your friend lost his son. I lost a friend 6 days after his 2nd Pfizer shot, I‚Äôm a military mom and my child‚Äôs right to chose an experimental vaccine with zero long term studies needs to be his! He‚Äôs being ostracized for refusing, as many are."
"@Elle68401613 @washingtonpost Yet here we are maskless and unvaccinated. Operation Warp speed actually was President Trumps failure with a lot of his base, ironically he got all you lunatics to hop on the Trump vaccine train, you‚Äôre more MAGA than u realize, you trust an experimental vaccine pushed by Trumpü§£"
My supervisor who genuinely doesn't understand why women don't trust men just got done talking about how he plans to trick this girl he met online into a meetup by forging a vaccine card.
"@JTMarlinLLC @CBSLA We trust the science. We just don't trust the anti-vaxxers to be honest. 

Anti-vaccine and anti-mask go hand-in-hand. Kids still can't be vaccinated and maskless unvaccinated a-holes can get them sick."
"@laurenboebert @SpeakerPelosi She trusts the vaccine, she doesn't trust you morons to get it."
@JamesYoungman19 @boilerskier @GarysheffieldJr However we do have evidence of long term covid as many are suffering from it.  Just because you survive it doesn‚Äôt mean you are rid of the consequences of getting it.  Trust me I know first hand.  I hope you get the vaccine as this has been very challenging.
@RoyalCaribPR @RoyalCaribbean We loved our Royal Caribbean cruise a few years ago and wanted to take one again someday. We will not be doing this however. My daughter has vax injury from Gardasil and do not trust this new vaccine. Only my husband got the jabs. The rest of us is a big NO!
"@GingerNaTT @PapayaChemist Trust me, if it was like COVID and affected everyone equally, there would have been effective treatments and maybe even a vaccine within a couple of years."
"@GeraldoRivera Trump already said it is fine to take vaccine, but he‚Äôs NOT a dictator and will NOT demand it. people who trust &amp; respect him do so because he believes in us. 30 people per day are dying from the vaccine all ages, only people dying from covid are over 70 basically!"
"@cmarinucci Terrible article, not one word on TX or Fl. CA numbers are great! 70% of adults vaccinated! Open up and stop trying to scare people! How about @VP saying she wouldn‚Äôt trust the vaccine if Trump ok it! Maybe that is a factor in some communities not getting vaccinated!"
"@JayRod212 @peacefullyduffn @MsVaccinaTurner @shivlordofsati @elvina_nawaguna @AOC @KaylaEpstein There are a few pushing back on it. Look, you want to trust big pharma &amp; the 1%, go for it. This vaccine has killed over 6K people that we know of, (hospitals aren‚Äôt reporting the real numbers), it‚Äôs experimental &amp; clinical trials are still ongoing. I‚Äôm not a lab rat- just sayin‚Äô"
@pfizer Ask a question:  Who was this #Vaccine tested on? Is it 100% safe and effective? Has it been approved by any regulatory agency? Do you trust a company that‚Äôs paid $2.3 billion in lawsuits? #Science #ScientificMethod #Truth https://t.co/CB4JUVZzgQ
@LeeLeeNY81 Funny. You trust Pfizer who has been sued&amp; had to pay out more than any other pharmaceutical company for fraud and injury (except for their vaccine injuries since they aren‚Äôt liable because there is the NVICP) or Moderna who NEVER had a product come to market yet. #sheep
"People don't trust the vaccine, but trust liquor and tobacco companies. üôÑ"
@chat4doobs @davidmweissman @Mfjean0213 Well excuse me ma‚Äôam everybody‚Äôs entitled to their own opinion the last time I knew this was a free country I know people that have gotten the vaccine I know one person who got paralyzed from my sister broke out in hives for three weeks it has not been tested I Don‚Äôt trust it
"@TaylorHettinger @davidmweissman @Mfjean0213 Thank you very much I don‚Äôt trust the vaccine I just went through cancer treatments I had enough Poison put in my body, I put nothing else in my body."
@Petert930 so you trust the vaccine by won‚Äôt trust your doctors diagnoses and medications
"@GalileanSea Man U be so clueless sometime. They lift the mandate, but if u haven‚Äôt had the vaccine and u are around folks u don‚Äôt know, that lift doesn‚Äôt mean u can trust folks u ain‚Äôt been around. Some folks have conditions that aren‚Äôt good!"
"@bbc5live @rachelburden @JonAshworth Official @JonAshworth is an anti vaxxer. Qualified scientists says the vaccine works against the variants. This luddite has no exit plan. Its always harder ,sooner, longer. There have been 12000 variants so far. Shadow health secretary? I wouldn't trust him with a yard brush"
New mask rules trust Americans will be honest about vaccine status. Experts say they will lie. https://t.co/zIj9Yz1ISX via @YahooNews
"@RealKiraDavis If they are vaxxed, what are they afraid of? It's either a) they don't trust the vaccine, b) they are a wuss and are now afraid of any minor symptom or c) they want to be in other people's business."
"@BessZylawy @ananavarro If you are vaccinated, why do you care about the unvaxxed? Either a) you don't trust the vaccine, b) you're a wuss afraid to get even minor symptoms or c) you want to be in other people's business. Which is it?"
@LeeSharpeNFL @PFF_Moo @benbbaldwin And I say this as someone who was ambivalent and getting vaccinated. The blind trust of pharma corp &amp; govt doesnt resonate. The post vaccine data does.
"@AlexGeddylfson @almondjoy893 @ClayGober The side effects from having COVID are far worse than any side effects from and of the vaccines. You may not ""trust the government"", but you know damn well trump wasn't in a lab sipping this random concoction til he liked one. This vaccine is from the world's most brilliant minds"
It‚Äôs obviously everybody totally trust that vaccine if you have to bribe them to take it Tim Walz needs to resign https://t.co/0fGy6AWQCH
"@DisappointedI11 @Allmercy007 @George_514 How? Liberals are tremendously uninformed, emotionally-driven individuals

They all want the vaccine and can't remember that it was the Trump vaccine in September that no one would trust"
"@gelliottmorris Vaccine polls seem like the perfect opportunity to put the whole ""low social trust voters don't respond to polls"" thing to the test. Based on that I would expect the % of vaccinated respondents to be much higher than the actual vaccination rate. Has that played out in your data?"
@ShilohStarrs @realist2016jlp @Liz_Wheeler Still don‚Äôt trust a vaccine processed this fast that has Bill Gates hand in it.
"@SiberiaCat3 @snopes I don't actually. I disagree with Trump pushing the vaccine(the one you took) and other things

BTW, I read your article even though I don't trust WebMD. You wouldn't even bother looking at mine. I could have picked other sites but I thought you might give this one a chance"
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust the government so I‚Äôm not going to take a vaccine that‚Äôs not approved by a govt institution.‚Äù https://t.co/dvHfVQCizr
"Let‚Äôs be honest...

Those that don‚Äôt trust the vaccine are people that don‚Äôt trust the government &amp; the media. Watching the bias for 4 years will make anyone skeptical about anything the mainstream media &amp; democrat officials are pushing.

This is self inflicted."
"@seanhannity Absolutely no one can trust the GQP and about 50% of conservatives in this country who opposed getting vaccine and and wearing masks and now we our suppose to believe them.fuck that you want voter I'd, same with vaccine id."
@NYGovCuomo Governor in 2014 you said that conservatives were not welcome in NY and should leave. Why then should I trust your vaccine given this attitude? https://t.co/BbzjmznIvR
"@Rachelmoor29 Vaxed AND masked. I don't trust everyone to do the right thing, I'm sure not every person walking around without a mask is really vaccinated. Besides, there's still a lot we might not know about the virus or the vaccine. Better safe than sorry, a mask is no bit deal."
@brittlestar As a conservative I have valid reasons for fearing this. Conservatives are being politically persecuted all over this nation. Here governor Cuomo publicly stated that we are not welcome in this state. Watch my video: https://t.co/BbzjmznIvR
https://t.co/BbzjmznIvR Mass censorship of our political ideology and political persecution are just two reasons why many conservatives shun the vaccine.
"@NYGovCuomo @NYstateparks Governor in 2014 you said that conservatives were not welcome in this state. Why should I trust you with this ""vaccine""?"
@darksecretplace I'm part of the Unvax'd/Had COVID camp.  Not getting the shot.  I've never had a flu shot either and at 50 y.o. I've had the flu maybe 1 or 2x.  I trust my body's natural immunity and reasonable healthy living over an experimental vaccine pushed by folks I don't trust.
"@PAWashingtonFan @russ_gruelle @AlWatterson @dagambla03 @Sam4TR Fair. But he is already misinformed. A vaccine is preventative, not treatment. That isn‚Äôt exactly subjective. A football player should be able to trust medical researchers and doctors‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not just giving up free thinking."
"@bpolitics You mean the Trump Vaccine that Kamala, Cuomo, said they did not trust back in October üòÜ"
I have been suffering from UTI‚Äôs for over a year now off and on. Ya girl will be the first one to get a vaccine for it. TRUST! https://t.co/9SzFUUrdrW
@RepThomasMassie They are clearly antivaxxers who don‚Äôt trust the vaccine? Maybe they need their booster shot? üòÇ
@PrisonPlanet They are antivaxxers. Clearly they don‚Äôt trust the vaccine works at all.
