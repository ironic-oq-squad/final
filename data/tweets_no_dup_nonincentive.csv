@whitestpatuknow @Timcast The problem I have with the mandatory push for these vaccines is why on earth should we trust a vaccine that did not go through animal trials like other vaccines. Our experts have been wrong too often. Why are the makers protected from having to pay Medicaid expenses if injured?

@HamillHimself @SuzanneCarr60 I will never understand why people don't trust in common sense. Fauci is part owner of 2 vaccines has made hundreds of millions from this Then the emails.

@DonaldTrumpsBe2 @LimitedRunJames @tbailey1976 @jeremynewberger @SeanOhhhh @RandPaul And no one knows the longterm affects of the vaccine.

@NHSouthernGirl @VinGuptaMD @IamNurseTrish You know when the Tuskegee experiment was happening DOCTORS told the victims otherwise didn't they? But let's put that aside. For me the vaccine was developed too fast. In addition to that I don't trust the paid spokespeople or government regarding this.
